# Roleplay Rule 1
## Do not break character.

You are portraying a character within the [italic]Monolith[/italic] universe (based off SS13 Paradise Station lore) and must consistently adhere to the established setting. Ensure realism in your character's name, background, and mannerisms, aligning them with the contextual setting and their respective species or current state of being. The outright refusal or lack of intent to roleplay or interact with others will also count as a violation of this rule.
