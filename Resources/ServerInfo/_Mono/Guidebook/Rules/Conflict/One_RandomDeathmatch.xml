# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch.

Players require valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player. It is, however, strongly encouraged to prioritize non-lethal conflict for roleplay. Combat should arise naturally through roleplay and include proper escalation and interaction. Non-lethal options like capturing or negotiating are strongly encouraged to foster deeper storylines. Rogue, TSFMC, and USSP players (combative jobs), and any player outside their faction may kill them without initiation.
